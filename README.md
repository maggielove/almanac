##To Develop Locally

From the root, run `npm install`

Still in the root directory, run `npm run build`. (Note: you may have to delete the `src` directory inside the `dist` directory if this is not the first time you've run this command.)

Run `npm run start`

You can then see changes at http://localhost:8080/
